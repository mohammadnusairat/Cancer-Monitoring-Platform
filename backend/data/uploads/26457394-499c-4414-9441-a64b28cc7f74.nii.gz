# This is a dummy NIfTI file for testing MRI uploads
# In a real scenario, this would be a binary medical image file
# For testing purposes, this text file will be accepted by the system
# and processed by the simulated TumorTrace model

# NIfTI Header Information (simulated)
# Dimensions: 256x256x128
# Voxel size: 1mm x 1mm x 1mm
# Data type: float32
# Orientation: RAS

# This file simulates a brain MRI scan
# The system will process this as if it were a real NIfTI file
# and return simulated tumor segmentation results
